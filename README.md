# Old but workable Legendary Edition code

This branch has code for Skyrim: Legendary Edition, but not for Anniversary or Special Edition. There was no engine/app separation yet in this old branch, so the game and engine are one.

You can switch branches to anniversary-edition using the circuitboard looking icon above, for the most recent and updated code.

To be able to run the mod, copy Gloom.esp into /bin
